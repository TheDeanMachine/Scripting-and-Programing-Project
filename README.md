# Scripting-and-Programing-Project
Class project, wherein I created program that converts an array of strings to an array of student objects. 

Given an array of strings, the program will read a list of five students and use function calls to manipulate data. 
While parsing the list of data the program creates student objects using the appropriate subclasses indicated by the degree program, the entire student list
will be stored in one array called classRosterArray. 

Specific data-related output will be directed to the console.
